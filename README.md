# Next Text Generation with LSTM

This repository contains a Python code implementation for generating text using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The code takes a text corpus as input and trains an LSTM model to predict the next character in a sequence. The trained model can then be used to generate new text based on a given input sequence.

# Introduction

This code demonstrates how to:
- Preprocess a text corpus for training
- Build an LSTM model for character-level text generation
- Train the model and evaluate its performance
- Use the trained model to generate text based on input sequences

# The notebook contains sections that:

- Import necessary libraries
- Load and preprocess the text corpus
- Build and train the LSTM model
- Evaluate the model's performance
- Generate text based on input sequences

# Results
After training the model, you'll be able to generate text using the model's predictions. The generated text will be based on the patterns learned from the input text corpus.

# Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- nltk
